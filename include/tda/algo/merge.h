/// Both are stable: equal elems keep the run they came from, the left run first. A partly
/// sorted span is therefore sorted by finding the boundary with tda_span_is_sorted_until
/// and merging.

/// writes two sorted spans into 'dst' as one sorted run
/// @param dst where it goes; must hold a.len + b.len and overlap neither source

/// @param b the other, sorted by the same 'cmp'
/// @param cmp the order both are in

///           it takes a path that needs no memory
/// @bigo{n} with a buffer, O(n log n) without — a refusal is a slower way to the same
